# 👤 User Management System (C Language)

A simple **Command-Line User Management System** built using the **C programming language**.  
This project allows users to **Register and Login** through a console-based interface.

It demonstrates fundamental C concepts like:
- Structures
- Arrays
- Functions
- Input Handling
- Basic Authentication Logic

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 User Registration
- 🔑 User Login Authentication
- 🙈 Password Masking (Hidden Input)
- 📋 Simple Menu Driven Interface
- ⚠️ Maximum User Limit Handling

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC
- Terminal-based execution

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/dipanshu-kashyap00/User-Management-System.git

2. Move to the project directory:

   cd User-Management-System

3. Compile the program:

   gcc UserManagement.c -o UserManagement

4. Run the program:

   ./UserManagement

---

## 📌 How It Works

- The program displays a simple menu-driven interface.
- Users can register with a username and password.
- Registered users can log in using valid credentials.
- User data is stored in memory using structures.
- The maximum number of users is limited by a predefined constant.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Maximum users are controlled by `MAX_USERS`.
- Data is stored temporarily (no file or database storage).
- Password masking works best on Linux/macOS terminals.
